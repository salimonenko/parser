# parser
 Simple webSite Parser. 
 I tested this my parser with HTTP-protocol only yet. 
 Works such features: 
 1. Following links. That is, the aproppriate webpage will be opened when the link is clicked
 2. Getting such resourses as: <img ... />, <script... ></script>, <link ... />. Wherein src or href may be absolute or relative.

To parse the webpage You need to enter it URL in the entery field and then click "Старт".
