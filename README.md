# parser
 Simple webSite Parser. 
 I tested this my parser with HTTP-protocol only yet. 
 Works such features: 
 1. Following links. That is, the aproppriate webpage will be opened when the link is clicked (as usual).
 2. Getting such resourses as: <img ... />, <script... ></script>, <link ... /> from a server. Wherein src or href may be absolute, relative or starting from the site root.

You need to enter it URL in the entery field and then click "Старт" to parse the webpage. You should  also click "Старт" after clicking the link to enter the another webpage  too.
